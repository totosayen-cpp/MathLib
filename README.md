# MathLib
A simple mathematical library written in C++

Hello, everyone !

There's MathLib, a small library in C++ for mathematics.
I've implemented fraction template, 2D matrix template, added constants and useful functions.
It's still under development, so new functionalities and improvements wil come soon.

I hope you'll enjoy.
